# Image Loader for Lights
## Quickly and easily load custom images and gifs onto the pixelstrip lights!
Made by Einar S. and Rohan V-F.
For FRC Team 3407 Wild Cards.

### Note:
This repository was a fork of QuantumKya/lights-img-loader, which is no longer being used for anything! 

## How To Use
- Load in your image
- Press the "Get Py Code!!!" button
- Get the Python code for the Pixelstrip, and use it!

## How It Works (Extremely simplified)
First, it scans through all the frames or the image and saves every unique color to the colorlist. It aslo collects data on every pixel (in every frame). Then, it writes and runs the code that makes the pixelstrip show your image/gif using the data that it collected earlier. We also utilize very poorly named variables that make the code impossible to read. Good luck!

P.S. There are good comments in the code, don't worry 😅
